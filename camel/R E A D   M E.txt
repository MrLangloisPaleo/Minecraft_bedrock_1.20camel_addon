thank you for downloading my addon!!


	To fully install the addon, you'll need to copy-paste or drag-and-drop the file named "Camel" that you can see in "Resource" INTO your main game's file called "resource_packs"

	Do the same thing to the file named "Camel" that you can see in "Behavior" INTO your main game's file called "behavior_packs"
	
	Afterwards, well, enjoy :D !!!! (if it works :I)
